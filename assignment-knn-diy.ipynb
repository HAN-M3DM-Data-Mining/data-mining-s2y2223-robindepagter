        "The dataset that is used in this kNN model, is that of people above the age of 21 who have been tested for diabetes. Some of these people are diabetic and some were tested not to be diabetic. The goal of the machine learning model that will be built is to determine, with the available data, whether or not a person could possibly be diabetic. By simply testing certain parts of the person's health, we could use the ML-model to quickly determine which person could have diabetes and who could not. This can then be used to further aid the person that has been tested.\n",
